# React Tic-Tac-Toe

Facebook has written a very good introduction for the [React](https://reactjs.org/) library. You can find it from [React Tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html).

## Do the tutorial in Browser

The tutorial can be run through without any installations by starting from [this code template in codepen](https://codepen.io/gaearon/pen/oWWQNa?editors=0010). And following the tutorial through [starting here](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html#overview).

## Run the tutorial locally

Once you have the application running in your local environment ([nodejs](https://nodejs.org/en/download/package-manager/) or [docker](https://docs.docker.com/install/)) you can edit the files in your editor and see the changes immediately in the browser window here [http://localhost:8000](http://localhost:8000).

### Prerequisites
